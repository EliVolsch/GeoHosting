# GeoServer

## What is GeoServer?

GeoServer is a Java-based server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards set forth by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/), GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing.

## Open and Share Your Spatial Data

GeoServer allows you to display your spatial information to the world. Implementing the [Web Map Service (WMS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) standard, GeoServer can create maps in a variety of output formats. [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), a free mapping library, is integrated into GeoServer, making map generation quick and easy. GeoServer is built on [GeoTools](http://geotools.org), an open-source Java GIS toolkit.

GeoServer conforms to the [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) and [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) standards, allowing data sharing and editing. It also uses the [Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts) standard to split maps into tiles for web and mobile applications.

GeoServer is modular, with additional functionality available via extensions. An extension for the [Web Processing Service (WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) opens up a wealth of processing options, and you can even write your own!

Enable others to incorporate your data into their websites and applications, freeing your data and permitting greater transparency.

## Use Free and Open Source Software

GeoServer is [free software](/license). This significantly lowers the financial barrier to entry compared to proprietary GIS products. In addition, GeoServer is open-source, allowing bug fixes and feature improvements to be made transparently and efficiently. Open-source software prevents vendor lock-in, saving costs on long-term support contracts.

---

## Integrate With Mapping APIs

We recommend both [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), which, when combined with GeoServer, provide an open-source solution for web mapping.

GeoServer can also display data on popular mapping applications such as:
- [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)
- [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)
- [MapBox](http://mapbox.com)

Additionally, GeoServer integrates with traditional GIS architectures such as [ESRI ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/arcgis).

## Join the Community

GeoServer has a large and vibrant community consisting of users and developers worldwide. Support is available through various sources, such as [email lists](/comm#email). A fixed [release cycle](/roadmap) and [public issue tracker](/issues) provide transparency and reliable updates. Additionally, [commercial support](/support) is available from various providers. With GeoServer, you are always in good company.
