GeoServer implements industry-standard OGC protocols such as Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). Additional formats and publication options are available as extensions, including Web Processing Service (WPS) and Web Map Tile Services (WMTS). Django BIMS is based on Django, which is a high-level python web framework. Django follows the model-template-views architecture pattern. Celery Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. It\u2019s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling. BIMS uses Celery for handling background tasks. PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. PostgreSQL helps to make up the database that stores and manages both the spatial data and information for BIMS. PostGIS PostGIS extends the capabilities of the PostgreSQL relational database by adding support storing, indexing and querying geographic data. PostGIS helps to make up the database that stores and manages both the spatial data and information for BIMS. OpenLayers OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles, vector data and markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. It is completely free, Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD). It is used for map interactions and geospatial operations in BIMS. Backbone.js Backbone.js is a JavaScript rich-client web app framework based on the model\u2013view\u2013controller design paradigm. BIMS uses it to provide specific front-end functionality..

Please refer to their individual documentation for in-depth technical information.</p> Logo Name Notes Django Django makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code. ReactJS React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like <code>Thumbnail</code>, <code>LikeButton</code>, and <code>Video</code>. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps. MUI Move faster with intuitive React UI tools. MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster. Start with Material UI, our fully-loaded component library, or bring your own design system to our production-ready components. Docker Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications. Docker helps developers build, share, and run applications anywhere \u2014 without tedious environment configuration or management. Celery Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system. It\u2019s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling. Celery Beat This extension enables you to store the periodic task schedule in your database. The periodic tasks can be managed from the Django Admin interface, where you can create, edit and delete periodic tasks and how often they should run. Django Rest Framework Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. MapLibre Open-source mapping libraries for web and mobile app developers. deck.gl is a WebGL-powered framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets. PostGIS PostGIS extends the capabilities of the PostgreSQL relational database by adding support storing, indexing and querying geographic data. PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. Tegola An open source vector tile server written in Go, Tegola takes geospatial data and slices it into vector tiles that can be efficiently delivered to any client. GDAL GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing."},{"location":"developer/geosight/#docker-components","title":"Docker Components","text":"<p>The following diagram represents the docker containers, ports and volumes that are used to compose this platform.</p> <p></p> <p>The docker volumes are used for the following purposes, with the following typical storage allocations:</p> NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES NOTES media-data 10Gi RWX azurefile Used for the uploaded files, example for XLS of file of importer.

Checklists from the SANParks BIMS should not be accepted at face value. The information that is used to produce the checklists has not been vetted and it is likely to have some errors in it. For example, users of iNaturalist and Observation.org may have selected an incorrect scientific name for an animal they have seen. Different sources, particularly citizen science platforms, can use scientific names of different taxonomic rank (species and subspecies) when referring to the same taxon, which in this case, is an animal with the same common name. This is not a problem when one scientific name is a synonym of the other, as the issue will be resolved through the use of the Accepted name. It is a problem when both the subspecies and species names are accepted but they are being used to refer to the same taxon (same common name). </p> <p>To finalise a checklist, the <code>incorrect</code> or redundant name can be removed and the source for the additional, redundant name can be shifted to the \u201ccorrect\u201d name. If you are unsure which name to use, then consider the sources and number of sources and occurrence records for the two names. Another rule of thumb that can be used, is where a common name refers to a species, then use the scientific name for the species name, as opposed to where a common name, such as blesbok, refers to a subspecies, where the scientific name for the subspecies should be used. The online version of Wilson and Reeder\u2019s Mammals of the World provides a useful resource for information on mammals.</p> <p>Another issue arises where the wrong subspecies has been named for a park e.g. confusing blue and black wildebeest or Mountain zebra and Burchell\u2019s zebra. There shouldn\u2019t be two subspecies co-occurring in a park, and where there are two subspecies, the one with the most sources and observations is likely to be correct. In all cases, the historical distribution range of one mammal subspecies will include the park, and that is the species that should be on the list.</p> <p>Below are some examples of redundant and incorrect names that appear on mammal checklists from the SANParks BIMS.</p> Incorrect Name Correct Name Common Name Notes Antidorcas marsupialis marsupialis Antidorcas marsupialis (Zimmermann, 1780) Springbok Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Caracal caracal caracal Caracal caracal (Schreber, 1776) Caracal Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Chlorocebus pygerythrus pygerythrus Chlorocebus pygerythrus (F.Cuvier, 1821) Vervet monkey Subspecies name only used on citizen science platforms Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell, 1823) Connochaetes gnou (Zimmermann, 1780) Black wildebeest One record of incorrect subspecies (Blue wildebeest) on citizen science platform.
